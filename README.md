For a project based on Olympics data analysis, the primary focus will be on exploring and understanding the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and uncovering trends and insights related to athletes, countries, and sports over the years.
Objective:
The primary goal is to:
1. Analyze the dataset to understand trends in medal distribution.
2. Identify the top-performing countries and athletes.
3. Study the gender distribution of events and medals.
4. Visualize the data using Python.
Steps:
1. Data Preparation:
○ Import libraries.
○ Load the dataset.
○ Clean the dataset (handling missing values, if any).
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
○ Summary statistics of the dataset.
○ Plot and analyze trends of medals across years.
○ Identify the top-performing athletes and countries.
3. Visualizing Key Insights:
○ Visualize the distribution of medals by country, year, and sport.
○ Analyze gender distribution in different sports/events.
4. Predictive Analysis:
○ Train a machine learning model to predict whether an athlete will win a
medal based on their country, sport, and other attributes.
